# 01-PROJECT Repository

This 01-PROJECT Repository has been created with the purpose of learning and practicing git and github.

I am using w3School tutorials to learn git.

I have learnt that the Git is a distributed version control system. There are other centralized version control systems like svn and Perforce.
